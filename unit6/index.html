		<p>Large 2BR in the heart of Venice! Welcome to a rustic beach cottage with modern amenities. The home is light and bright, within walking distance to the beach, and even closer is the hip Abbot Kinney Blvd.</p>
		<p>Just a block away from Abbot Kinney Blvd., our property gives you access to a trendy neighborhood and one of the most amazing food and shopping destinations in all of L.A. This stretch is green and beautiful, covered in vines and with more sightseeing than you could possibly cover in one trip.</p>
		<p>We're a short walk to famous Venice Beach, where you can surf, swim, paddle board, or simply relax with family and friends. The boardwalk is wonderful to stroll and take in culture and sights. There's so much to do within walking distance, I only hope your stay is long enough for you to experience it all!</p>

		<p>This private Venice Beach cottage welcomes you with rustic hardwood floors, classic Restoration Hardware furniture and antiques, and ample space to vacation as a group.</p>
		<p>The master bedroom and smaller bedroom each have large, sunlit windows and a Queen-sized bed with new clean linens, soft pillows and comforters. Both bedrooms are private, with a dresser and a solid door that closes. The larger bedroom also features rustic night stands, and the smaller bedroom has a walk-in closet and a desk where you can get some work done.</p>
		<p>The dining room table is solid wood, and near two large windows so you can bask in sunlight as you plan your next move to the beach or Abbot Kinney Blvd. You can also kick back in the living room, and enjoy Netflix on the Smart TV (account already set up). Other amenities include fast WiFi so you can stay connected on all your devices.</p>
		<p>Prepare home cooked meals in our kitchen, newly-renovated with full modern appliances - stove, oven, toaster oven, and refrigerator, as well as a blender, coffee-maker and plenty of dishware, glasses, pots and pans. You can enjoy your meals inside, or outside on our deck breakfast nook overlooking the front yard.</p>
		<p>The main full bathroom is newly renovated with both a shower and separate bathtub for long soaks. We provide bath products, and plenty of clean, freshly-laundered towels.</p>
		<p>You'll find plenty of street parking as well as a designated spot at the back of the house, which is located on the 900 block of Victoria Ave. between Lincoln and Linden Blvd. - check the map before booking!</p>
