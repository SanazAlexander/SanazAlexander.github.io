<h2> Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<P>I am inspired by the following sites:</p>
<ul>
	<a href="airbnb.com"</a> 
	<a href="http://www.siteinspire.com/websites/5008-matthew-calvin"</a>
</ul>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<P>Airbnb: Airbnb uses a lot of white space in their responsive design. They use still video for the main photo image. Strong call to action for booking by inputing dates and for listing your property, the two main flows they want the user to embark on.</P>
